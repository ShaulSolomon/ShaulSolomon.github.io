**Objective: Generative Language Model to serve as an AI Guru.**

> "[T]he guru’s job is to show the inquirer in some effective way that they are already what they are looking for." - Alan Watts 

While I am still writing the code, I don't want to share too much about the technical aspect just yet.

# [MAFAT Radar Detection Challenge](https://github.com/ShaulSolomon/sota-mafat-radar)

Participated in the 2020 Radar Detection Challenge by The Israeli Ministry of Defense "Directorate of Defense Research & Development" (DDR&D) <br>
<a href="https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/25389#learn_the_details"> Competition Details </a> <br>

> The participants’ goal is to classify segments of radar tracks of humans or animals using the I/Q signal matrix as an input. The task at hand is a binary classification task; the tracked objects are either humans or animals.
The data is real-world data, gathered from diverse geographical locations, different times, sensors, and qualities (high- and low-signal to noise ratio—SNR).

Working together with three friends from Y-Data, we got to the respective 24th place.

# [Industry Project - Author Name Disambiguation](https://github.com/ShaulSolomon/academix-ydata-project-truncated)

This a truncated and redacted version of the original project. Without the data or the company-provided code, none of the notebooks will be directly usable, but extracting functions and pipelines are viable.

For the industry project of the Y-Data course, I partnered up with Academix and helped them deal “Author Name Disambiguation”. Fundamentally, given a group of academix papers, we wanted to figure out how many unique authors existed, and to assign each paper to their respective author.
