# [Industry Project - Author Name Disambiguation](https://github.com/ShaulSolomon/academix-ydata-project-truncated)

This a truncated and redacted version of the original project. Without the data or the company-provided code, none of the notebooks will be directly usable, but extracting functions and pipelines are viable.

For the industry project of the Y-Data course, I partnered up with Academix and helped them deal “Author Name Disambiguation”. Fundamentally, given a group of academix papers, we wanted to figure out how many unique authors existed, and to assign each paper to their respective author.
